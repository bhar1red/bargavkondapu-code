## Interests
- Love jeeps and slow driving, exploring new places.
- Interested in photography - capturing candid expressions and crucial moments.
- Like mixing philosophy, mythology, movies, cartoons, technology and everyday life.
- Always up for discussion over a beer!


## Philosophy

I am heavily inspired from the works of Napoleon Hill, Charles Bukowski, Tony Robbins, Simon Sinek, Gary Vaynerchuk. My philosophy can be summarized in these 5 quotes.

- 1 > 0 - Gary Vee
- Invent yourself and then reinvent yourself - Charles Bukowski
- People donâ€™t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. - Simon Sinek
- Learn the almost forgotten art of asking questions and then listening to their answers - Napoleon Hill
- It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. - Napoleon Hill

Though our philosophy keep updating everyday, it is reflected in my work and life. Most of my blog-posts share detailed description of things I believe in.

## Technical
I build highly scalable and robust websites. My work focuses mostly on writing API's and developing custom modules for Drupal. I love learning about all the aspects involved with developing websites, good with frontend, configuring servers and writing build scripts as well.
