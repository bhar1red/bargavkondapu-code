Happiness and fulfillment are two different things. Anyone can be happy. It's a state of mind. It's a choice that one can make and be happy in seconds.

On the other hand, fulfillment is rare and precious. One need to work, follow his passion, contribute, help, succeed to be fulfilled. It takes years of dedicated hard work and commitment for just seconds of feeling fulfilled.
