[comment]: # (A note is any quick thought, quote, one-liners or a simple tweet. )

If you want to be a photographer, don't mind taking numerous bad clicks.   

If you want to be a dancer, don't mind performing some awkward moves.  

If you want to be a singer, don't mind messing up tunes with your voice.   

If you want to be a programmer, don't mind throwing thousands of errors.   

If you want to be a cricketer, don't mind numerous misfields and mishits.  

What ever profession you choose, who ever the expert you take, they all were once amature, made thousands of silly mistakes. It took years of practice and constant efforts, to make them experts.
