[comment]: # (A note is any quick thought, quote, one-liners or a simple tweet. )

Einstein theorized and we all agree that E=mc², where E, m and c represents energy, mass and the speed of light respectively.

E, m and c are not almighty that come and solve your problems. They are just an arbitrary representations used to explain a theory.

Same is with Shiva, Vishnu, Jesus, Allah, Durga... and all 1 million+ gods.
