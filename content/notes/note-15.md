[comment]: # (A note is any quick thought, quote, one-liners or a simple tweet. )

That moment, you spend 2 hours of your time researching, how to eat tidy, with a full beard and mustache. 😎

Here are few quick tips for fellow bearded men
1. Drink using straws or Bottles with narrow necks.
2. Take smaller bites. Prefer using forks and knifes.
3. Use napkins. The pocket napkins and moustache curling seem to be the most socially acceptable options.
4. Say No to junk foods that leave crumbs.
5. Brush/Comb/ stroke your beard often.

Any additional advices welcome! 😁
