[comment]: # (A note is any quick thought, quote, one-liners or a simple tweet. )

Society always tries to define stereotypes and have constraints on one's looks. May it be dark/fair tones, thick/thin body types, facial hairs, (there is even a useless book, that judge people's character based on eyebrow lining).

Well, growing a beard some how forces me to think beyond stereotypes, look into people's hearts.
