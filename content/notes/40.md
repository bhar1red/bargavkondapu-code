[comment]: # (A note is any quick thought, quote, one-liners or a simple tweet. )

My teachers words, a decade ago (exactly on 1.1.11). Still keeps me inspired and be greatful for every moment.

"If you people celebrate New Year, Then why don't you celebrate every day. Because every day is a new day. Every Moment is a special one."
- Dr. P. Padmaja
