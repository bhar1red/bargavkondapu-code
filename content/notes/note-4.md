[comment]: # (A note is any quick thought, quote, one-liners or a simple tweet. )

Teeram telisaka, unko darini marchana?  
Darulu sari aina, vere teeram cherana?  
Nadakalu navena? Nadichedi nenena??  

Engish:
Have I changed my route, after knowing the destination? or
Have I reached wrong destination, despite going on the correct route?
Is it my journey? Am I the one walking?

Kudos to lyric writer - Ananth Sriram
