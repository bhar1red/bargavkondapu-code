# Comment Policy - bargavkondapu.com 

#### Keep it civil

We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive, we need to remember to  **criticize ideas, not people**.  

So, remember to avoid:

-   name-calling
-   ad hominem attacks
-   Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
-   knee-jerk contradiction

Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be treated.

#### Keep it tidy

-   don’t post off-topic comments or discussions.
-   don’t cross-post the same thing multiple times
-   check if another active discussion on your topic has already been posted

#### No Self-promotion

A discussion or comment that contains only a link to your blog, a product, or your article on another site will almost always be removed.

#### Choose Your (Curse) Words Wisely

Comments that contain profanity are automatically held for moderator review before being posted. Depending on the context of the comment, it may be removed. Profanity used to insult, antagonize, or inflame will always be removed.

#### Don’t Be a Jerk

Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. Sexist, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are simply not allowed. Comments or discussions written intentionally to provoke will also be removed.

#### Don’t Copy and Paste

If you didn’t write it, or haven’t properly cited the article you’re quoting, don’t post it.

#### English Only

This site currently only support English-only discussions. Non-English comments and discussions will be removed.
