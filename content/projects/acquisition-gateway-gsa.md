The [Acquisition Gateway](https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov) is your workspace for acquisition professionals and federal buyers to connect with resources, tools and each other to improve acquisition government-wide.

This website is built in Drupal 7 and AngularJS, in a progress decoupled architecture. Aside from regular updates and changes, I have enhanced search functionality, developed custom modules to remove duplicate taxonomy  and to create organic groups based on taxonomy.

**Project URL:** https://hallways.cap.gsa.gov

**Technologies Used :**  [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/),  [Github](https://github.com/), [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [AngularJS](https://angular.io/).
