The American Institute of Architects is a professional organization for architects in the United States. I feel privileged to work for this organization. As a web developer there, from 2015-2016, we built this website, using Drupal 8 and EmberJS.

This project is one of early adopters of 'Progressive Decoupled' architecture. We made use Drupal8's REST API and Ember Datastore and Ember fastboot to achieve this.



**Technologies Used :**  Drupal, EmberJS, NodeJs, ElasticSearch, Travis-CI, Github, Amazon AWS.
