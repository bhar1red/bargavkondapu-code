[comment]: # (Project should contain Summary, Description, Repo and Live urls, Screenshot or demo video and Tutorials( if any.))

[The American Institute of Architects](https:://www.aia.org) is a professional organization for architects in the United States. I feel privileged to work for this organization. As a web developer there, from 2015-2016, we built this website, using Drupal 8 and EmberJS.

This project is one of early adopters of 'Progressive Decoupled' architecture. We made use Drupal8's REST API and Ember Datastore and Ember fastboot to achieve this.

**Project URL:** https://www.aia.org/

**Technologies Used :**  [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [EmberJS](https://www.emberjs.com/),
