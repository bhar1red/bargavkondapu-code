[Architectural Adventures](https://www.architecturaladventures.org/) is the official travel program of [The American Institute of Architects](https://www.aia.org/), offering first-rate experiences in breathtaking destinations across the globe.

This is implemented during my job at AIA. It follows the same architecture and principles as that of the the [previous project](/projects/the-american-institute-of-architects).

**Project URL:** https://www.architecturaladventures.org/

**Technologies Used :**  [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [EmberJS](https://www.emberjs.com/),
 [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Github](https://github.com/), [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
