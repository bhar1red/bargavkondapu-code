[comment]: # ( Post include personal views, articles, tutorials. )

I was scrolling through my news feed, and shocked at what I found.

First, It was a story about a news paper vendor that helped Bill Gates when he doesn't have money.  - Fake

Next, It was a story about an interaction between JRD Tata and Amitabh - Fake.

Then, another couple of posts describing interactions where either candidates outsmarted interviewers or employees outsmarted their bosses. - Fake <br/>
Followed by a question of "what do you think?" or "Follow for more such stories".

Problem is, such posts gets you views, likes, and LinkedIn connections but can never form a real connection.  At some point, people differentiate between genuine and fake ones. When that happens, you might loose your authenticity and trust.

Digital Marketing is not just about quick views and likes, its about being authentic, gaining trust and earning loyal customers.
