[comment]: # (Interactions with strangers )


Not exactly a stranger, A very good friend of mine - Mr. X, A young entrepreneur, own a digital marketing agency.

Me: How is life going?

X: Life has been very forgiving & really made the last few years easy. Expanding company across other cities.

Me: Cool! 'Life has been forgiving and easy', good to hear that line when most of us were complaining 'it sucks! '

X: Probably MBA effect or really our talent - but really doing good compared to competition & many others of same age group. So, can't complain. Just have to learn & keep growing.
