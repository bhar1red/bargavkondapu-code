[comment]: # (Interactions with strangers )

Me: So what is one change or action, that you think would make a difference in a person's life?

X: (After a minute of thinking) Have you ever asked or being asked by others, questions like what do you do? what are you doing? what next? what for? ...

Me: Yes. Almost all the time...

X: If a person asks those questions to him/her self, it would make all the difference.
