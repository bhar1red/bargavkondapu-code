Interaction with stranger, X with a camera at a coffee shop

Me : you seem to be a great photographer.

X (with attitude) : You see my friend, There are no great photographers, just great photos.

Me : wow! that itself says how good photographer you are. Can I have look at your snaps?

X : huh well...It's my friends camera. He'll be coming in 5 min. And I'm not a photographer.

*followed by silent smile, that turned into a huge laughter and Hi5*
