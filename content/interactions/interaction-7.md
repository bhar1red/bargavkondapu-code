![We all take risks](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkjdeuwlv/image/upload/c_scale,w_auto,q_auto,f_auto/v1522513781/bargavkondapu.com/IWS-take-risks.jpg)

A middle aged entreprenuer, X, who own a franchise restaurant in DC.

Me: How were you able to take such a risk ?

X : Let me ask you a question. How do you commute to work?

Me : I Drive.

X : You know that there is a 5% chance of you meeting with an accident and 55% if you were texting and driving.

Me : Yes. Whats up with that?

X : You drove to work. Didn't sat at home, afraid of accidents. I've done the same. Drove my self to the destination.

*We all take risks, whether we acknowledge it or not. Better risk for things we love.*
