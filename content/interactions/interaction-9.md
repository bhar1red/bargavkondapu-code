Mr. X, A Developer, Guitarist, Writer, Photographer, Entrepreneur, Boxer, Stocks ... (Not a beginner, Successful in all those fields)

Me : wow! , So how were you able to master all these skills?

X : I didn't master all those skills, I master the basics and that too not all at once.

Me : oh! Could you be more specific? please.

X : Okay! let me explain.

Imagine you didn't knew how to read english. I can tell you a 100 words and their spellings, Yet, for 101st word, you will not be able to read it.  
Where as, if I teach you the 26 alphabets and how they sound. You will be able to read majority of the words, even sentences.   Same applies to any skill, any task.  
One must learn the basics and infact master them, in order to be good at any skill.  

Me : [Silent!! looking at him. ]

X : And that's one of the main reasons why many people can not get good at a something.  
People want to learn Despacito lyrics, but they don't want to know Spanish or how each word is pronounced. People wanna dance like Usher, but don't wanna pop, lock or learn basics of hip-hop. Same applies everywhere. Any skill is mastered by constant practice of it's basics.
