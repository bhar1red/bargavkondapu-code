[comment]: # (Interactions with strangers )

Encounter with an young old man X in the bus today morning.

Me : hi, good morning!

X : hi, are you wishing me good morning or just saying that it's a good morning?

Me : wishing... Hey, isn't that Gandalf's dialogue from Lord of the rings??

X ( smiling ) : yeah. You watch lengthy movies but lazy enough to wish properly.

Me ( smiling ) *facepalm* : okay! Have a Good Morning. :)

X : Thank you. You too.
