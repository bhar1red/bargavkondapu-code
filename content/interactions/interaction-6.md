[comment]: # (Interactions with strangers )

Met a young person X, at a store, with a 2-3 month growing beard, and he, constantly rubbing his fingers at one area of the beard

Me : Don't do that bro. In long run, it might form patches. If you want, use full hand/ four fingers together, rub it over top.

X : Growing beard isn't as easy as you think buddy. Try to grow it, you will then understand.

Me, smiling (Almost laughing) : Good luck ðŸ˜‚

Casue this was me, a few days before this happened.
