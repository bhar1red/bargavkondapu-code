[comment]: # (Interactions with strangers )

![Prive is what we pay, value is what we get](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkjdeuwlv/image/upload/c_scale,w_auto,q_auto,f_auto/v1541988626/bargavkondapu.com/posts/lady-driving.jpg)

Interaction with a Lyft driver, Ms. X, as soon as I got into the car and greeted her with big smile and a happy face.

X: Wow! you seem to be very happy.

Me: Yeah. It is a bright day...
...
(continued discussing about random topics for some time )
...
X: You know, we don't get to see a lot of happy faces in DC. People are always serious, sad or looking into phones.

Me: Sometimes, I feel the same too. Look at them (pointing to few pedestrians), All of them are serious.

Me: Maybe, I would have been like that too, if it wasn't for that guy who was all cheerful and happy while giving my documents before (Went to Indian Embassy to pickup some documents).  
I guess, happiness is contagious. I am pretty sure, your next customer will be happy seeing your face now.

X: They sure do. I guess it's like the ripple thing, people keep talking about.
