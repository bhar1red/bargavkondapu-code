[comment]: # (Interactions with strangers )

Interaction with a stranger, X, who traveled more than 25 major cities all over world.

Me : You seem to travel a lot. so what's one thing you enjoy in your journeys?

X : You know, people always wear masks. At home, at school, at work... That's nothing wrong, as they have a story and a reason behind it.
But it is only during journeys, you get to see their true selfless faces.

Me : So deep!! btw, I kept a similar post in my facebook recently (Showing him one of my profile pics)

X : Well then, we both might have copied from the same source.
