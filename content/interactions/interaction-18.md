[comment]: # (Interactions with strangers )

An interaction with Mr. X, Doctor by profession and a Social worker by heart, at the airport waiting for our flight. Discussing ways to empower people from remote/ backward areas

Me: So why do you think the majority of the people that are hunger-stricken or poor unable to think big?

X: Okay! Tell me are you a 'Glass is half-full' person or ' Glass is half-empty' person?

Me: 'Half-full' may be!

X: Well, for a person that is thirsty, doesn't care if it's half-full or half-empty, He would just drink it.
