[comment]: # (Interactions with strangers )

Conversation with a middle aged entrepreneur X (currently working in US), who had plans to set up a company in Vizag.

X : I should probably look for another city. Who would setup a company in a cyclone prone area? It's dream of 'IT hub' will be a dream.

Me: Where else would you find people, whose spirits aren't deterred even by such destruction?  
where else would you find people that help everyone in the team, even if it's not their job?  
where else would you find people working, building their city back, even without power and with food, water shortages ?  
where else would you find people that don't keep complaining and move on irrespective of circumstances?  

Now, just relate these to a project in your company. Trust me, you can never find a better place than Vizag.


*Spoken in relation to HudHud cyclone, that happened in Vizag, 2014.
